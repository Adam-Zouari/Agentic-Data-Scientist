# Evaluation of Multi-Agent Agentic AI System

## Overview

This document presents the evaluation of the multi-agent data science system across two different datasets. The evaluation assesses:
1. Quality and reasonableness of proposed plans
2. Consistency between EDA and actual datasets
3. Plausibility of proposed baseline models
4. System limitations and failure modes
